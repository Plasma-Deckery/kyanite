# Kyanite — Deckery fork

> Fork of [MurderFromMars/Kyanite](https://github.com/MurderFromMars/Kyanite) maintained as part of the [Plasma Deckery](https://github.com/Plasma-Deckery) project.
>
> For general documentation see the [upstream README](https://github.com/MurderFromMars/Kyanite#readme).

## What’s different from upstream

**Single-column vertical grid layout** (`updateRows()`):

Kyanite manages desktops dynamically but does not update KDE’s desktop grid layout. On vertical display setups (or when using a single-column workspace switcher) the grid stays multi-column regardless of how many desktops exist.

The patch adds an `updateRows()` function called whenever a desktop is added or removed, forcing a single-column layout:

```js
function updateRows() {
    const count = workspace.desktops.length;
    workspace.desktopGridHeight = count;
    workspace.desktopGridWidth = 1;
}
```

Submitted upstream as [PR #3](https://github.com/MurderFromMars/Kyanite/pull/3).

# Kyanite | Smart Dynamic Workspace Management for Plasma 6

A Plasma 6 native KWin script that delivers intelligent, self maintaining virtual desktops. Kyanite creates new desktops when you need them, removes empty ones when you don’t, and keeps your workspace numbering stable and predictable.

## Overview

Kyanite transforms KDE Plasma’s virtual desktops into a fluid, adaptive workspace. Instead of manually adding or removing desktops, you simply work and Kyanite handles the rest.

It ensures:

- A new empty desktop always exists at the end
- Empty desktops are automatically removed
- Windows shift downward to fill gaps
- Your current desktop index is preserved during cleanup
- The system never drops below one desktop

The result is a clean, infinite feeling workspace that expands and contracts based on your actual usage.

## Features

### Automatic Desktop Creation
Whenever a window lands on the last desktop, Kyanite instantly creates a new one after it. You always have room to keep working.

### Automatic Desktop Compaction
Kyanite continuously monitors for empty desktops and removes them, but only from the end of the list. This prevents gaps and keeps the desktop list tidy.

### Intelligent Window Shifting
When a desktop is removed, windows on higher indexed desktops shift down one position to maintain a clean sequence.

### Index Preserving Behavior
If compaction occurs while you are working, Kyanite keeps you on the same numbered desktop whenever possible.

### Plasma 6 Compatibility Layer
A dedicated compatibility wrapper normalizes Plasma 6 API differences, ensuring:

- Consistent desktop creation and removal
- Reliable window list access
- Stable signal handling
- Safe client desktop reassignment

### Animation Safe Execution
An internal animationGuard prevents recursive calls and avoids KWin animation glitches or event storms.

## How It Works

### Desktop Monitoring
Kyanite listens to:

- windowAdded
- windowRemoved
- desktopsChanged
- currentDesktopChanged
- Per client desktopsChanged

### Window Tracking
For each window, Kyanite checks:

- Which desktop it belongs to
- Whether it sits on the last desktop
- Whether its movement should trigger desktop creation

### Empty Desktop Detection
A desktop is considered empty if:

- No windows are assigned to it
- Windows on it are not skipPager
- Windows are not onAllDesktops

### Compaction Logic
When cleaning up:

1. Iterate backward through desktops
2. Identify empty desktops
3. Shift windows down to fill gaps
4. Remove the last desktop
5. Ensure at least one desktop remains
6. Ensure the last desktop is always empty

### Index Preservation
Before compaction, Kyanite records your current desktop index.  
After compaction, it restores you to the same index whenever possible.

# Known Limitations

## Manual Desktop Manipulation

Kyanite is designed to manage virtual desktops automatically. When desktops are created or removed manually, Plasma behaves in ways that Kyanite cannot safely track or correct.

### Manual Desktop Removal
Removing a desktop manually through the Overview, Pager, shortcuts, or System Settings causes Plasma to renumber desktops before Kyanite receives any signals. This can result in:

- Incorrect desktop numbering
- Unexpected compaction behavior

Kyanite will continue running, but the workspace layout may become temporarily inconsistent.

### Manual Desktop Addition
Adding desktops manually will work but the script will remove any extra empty desktops on the next compaction event

### Manually Switching Windows to Other Workspaces

Due to a Plasma Wayland issue, manipulating virtual desktops while a window drag is in progress could cause a full system hard lock. Kyanite now pauses all desktop operations during window drags and resumes once you release, resolving this as much as possible without a fix on KWin's end.
Compaction checks have also been made more aggressive any workspace switch or new window will trigger a correction pass to keep things tidy.

***Known caveat:*** if you drag the only window in a workspace directly to the final empty workspace, you may briefly end up with no trailing empty desktop and a gap in the middle. Kyanite will self-correct the moment you switch workspaces or open a new window. This edge case appears to be a Plasma quirk, as overview won't even let you drag a workspace's last remaining window out in the first place. 

### Additional Note

Multi‑monitor setups should work without issues. I only have a single‑display system to test on, but Plasma manages virtual desktops globally and this script doesn’t alter that behavior. In theory, it should function the same across multiple monitors since all screens share the same desktop list.

Kyanite is not written to work with X11, (which handles desktop objects, completely differently) so, in the name of keeping things simple this project is **Wayland only**

## Credit and Inspiration

Kyanite began life as a fork of dynamic_workspaces by Maurges, a project that explored similar ideas around adaptive virtual desktops. Seeking to improve the experience, the codebase has evolved so much  that remaining a fork no longer makes sense. The logic, structure, and behavior have changed to the point where Kyanite has become its own distinct project. with virutally none of the origiinal code remaining, and so this brings me to this project being relicensed,
